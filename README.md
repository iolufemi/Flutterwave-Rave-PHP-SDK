# Rave PHP SDK :wink:

> Class documentation can be found here [https://flutterwave.github.io/Flutterwave-Rave-PHP-SDK/packages/Default.html](https://flutterwave.github.io/Flutterwave-Rave-PHP-SDK/packages/Default.html)

Use this library to integrate your PHP app to Rave.

Edit the `paymentForm.php` and `processPayment.php` files to suit your purpose. Both files are well documented.

Simply redirect to the `paymentForm.php` file on your browser to process a payment.

The vendor folder is committed into the project to allow easy installation for those who do not have composer installed.
It is recommended to update the project dependencies using;

```shell
$ composer install
```

## Sample implementation

In this implementation, we are expecting a form encoded POST request to this script.
The request will contain the following parameters.

- payment_method `Can be card, account, both`
- description `Your transaction description`
- logo `Your logo url`
- title `Your transaction title`
- country `Your transaction country`
- currency `Your transaction currency`
- email `Your customer's email`
- firstname `Your customer's firstname`
- lastname `Your customer's lastname`
- phonenumber `Your customer's phonenumber`
- pay_button_text `The payment button text you prefer`
- ref `Your transaction reference. It must be unique per transaction.  By default, the Rave class generates a unique transaction reference for each transaction. Pass this parameter only if you uncommented the related section in the script below.`

You can also find the class documentation in the docs folder. There you will find documentation for the `Rave` class and the `EventHandlerInterface`.

Enjoy... :v:

## ToDo

- Write Unit Test
- Support Direct Charges
- Support Tokenized payment
